# Program6-7(read_numbers)

# This program demonstrates how numbers that are
# read from a file must be converted from strings
# before they are used in a math operation.

def main():
    # Open a file for reading.
    infile=open('numbers.txt','r')

    # Read three numbers from file.
    num1=int(infile.readline())
    num2=int(infile.readline())
    num3=int(infile.readline())

    # Close the file.
    infile.close()

    # Add the three numbers.
    total=num1+num2+num3

    # Display the numbers and their total.
    print('The numbers sre:',num1,num2,num3)
    print('Their total is:', total)

# Call the main function
